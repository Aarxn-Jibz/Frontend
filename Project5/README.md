# Music App is a Music Streaming and Playlist Management Application using Angular and TypeScript

## Run COde
To run code just enter
```
ng serve
```
into any terminalwith the folder as pwd.

## Objective:

Design and build an Music Streaming and Playlist Management Application using Angular and TypeScript to allow users to browse songs, play audio tracks, create playlists, and manage their favorite artists. This project will help learners understand and apply Angular’s complete ecosystem—components, routing, dependency injection, services, forms, observables, and Angular Material—to build a modern, media-rich single-page application (SPA).

**Reference Tools & Technologies:**

Framework: Angular (v17 or latest)

Language: TypeScript

UI Library: Angular Material

Development Tools: Node.js, Angular CLI, Visual Studio Code

Mock Backend: JSON Server or static JSON files for songs, artists, and playlists

**Approach:**

1. Setup and TypeScript Fundamentals

Set up the Angular environment using Angular CLI and Node.js.

Define TypeScript interfaces and classes for Song, Artist, Album, and Playlist.

Apply TypeScript features (interfaces, inheritance, enums, access modifiers) to ensure a clean data structure.

2. Angular Architecture and Component Design

Create modular Angular components to organize functionality:

song-list – displays all songs with play, add-to-playlist, and favorite options

song-player – manages play/pause, progress bar, and track controls

playlist-manager – allows users to create, edit, and delete playlists

artist-detail – displays artist biography and top tracks

navbar – provides navigation (Home, Artists, Playlists, Now Playing)

Use data binding, event binding, and directives (*ngIf, *ngFor, [ngClass], [ngStyle]) to dynamically manage the music list and UI updates.
