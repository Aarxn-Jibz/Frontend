        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>
            "Avatar" is a science fiction epic set in the mid-22nd century on Pandora, a lush moon inhabited by the
            Na’vi, a tall, blue-skinned species. Jake Sully, a paraplegic former Marine, is sent to Pandora to operate
            an avatar — a genetically engineered Na’vi body — to interact with the locals. As he integrates into Na’vi
            society, he learns their culture and deep connection to nature. Torn between following orders from the human
            corporation exploiting Pandora’s resources and protecting the Na’vi, Jake faces a moral choice. The story
            explores themes of environmentalism, colonialism, and identity against a visually stunning alien backdrop.

            <p>"You know the feeling when you start watching a movie, realizing it's almost 3 hours, and
                saying to yourself - "Well this is probably gonna be mostly boring", well, the creators of this movie
                didn't
                let that happen, rest assures.From the beginning up until the ending, every scene is perfected,
                with amazing acting, stunning directing, great visual effects, and astounding sound effects.
                The story building is just great, characters are well-developed, and the concept is brilliant. The only
                thing
                that's missing to me, is a fitting-soundtrack which could've give some scenes a great boost.I avoided
                watching
                this movie for a long time, because it just seemed a little ridiculous to me (Come on there are blue
                people)
                but I'm so glad I finally decides to give it a chance, and boy did it serve.
                Loved it. 9.5/10."</p>

            <p>"A film with the scope of James Cameron's Avatar was always going to be a risk both artistically and
                financially, especially in today's economic climate. Whether it will pay off monetarily is a question
                only time can answer, but this viewer can at the very least attest to it being an artistic triumph.

                Avatar brings us as close as cinema ever has to actually visiting an alien world. The beautiful
                environs, the exotic creatures and incredibly lifelike natives of Pandora arrest the senses, visually,
                aurally and emotionally. The world in Avatar is the true star of the show. The amount of detail and work
                that has gone into bringing this new world alive is seriously impressive, and it will be a while before
                we see anything that overtakes it in scope and quality. WETA Workshop and ILM have truly outdone
                themselves.

                Relative newcomer, Aussie Sam Worthington provides a solid human heart amongst all the
                science-fiction/fantasy beauty and Zoe Saldana gives an impressive performance as the 8 foot tall Na'vi,
                Neytiri. Even though the characters they both play are blue, giant, catlike aliens, they managed to
                evoke a chemistry and likability that pierces through the special effects.

                That's not to say that everything is perfect. The story is basic and dare I say, clichéd and
                predictable. We have seen it plenty of times in all forms of media. The bad guys are cartoonishly evil,
                and sadly paper thin. The love story, while charming, is also clichéd despite being between man and
                alien. But in the face of these shortcomings, Avatar is a success because its storytelling lies in the
                brilliant visuals.

                Avatar is a beautiful piece of film and a true event. It does exactly what cinema was always intended to
                - it takes us away from our problems and worries for a few hours and gives us memorable images which
                will undoubtedly and deservedly enter into the cultural lexicon to stay for the foreseeable future"</p>
