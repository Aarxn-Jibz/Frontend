Avatar Movie Info Website
This project was made to complete the assignment given by L&T professionals. The topic was to create a Movie Info page and the Movie we have chosen for this Project is Avatar(2009) directed by James Cameron. This project helped us learn many things about HTML and CSS particularly how to integrate different fonts locally and create responsive layouts using the flexbox model. The images and the fonts were sourced from Google.
